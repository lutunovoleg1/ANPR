Automatic recognition of car license plates on video using YOLO and EasyOCR models. YOLO will be used for the object detection task, EasyOCR - for the optical character recognition task, and an algorithm has also been implemented that determines the coordinates of the license plate corners using an algorithm based on the Hough algorithm.

## Installation
1. Make sure that you have Python version 3.11 installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:lutunovoleg1/ANPR.git

```
3. Install the dependencies from the file requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run main.py to perform license plate recognition on video.
  
You can change the following parameters of ```auto_number_plate_rec``` function:
- **video_path** (str): The path to the input video file. 
- **save_video** (bool): If True, the processing result is saved to a video file. By default, False.
- **show_video** (bool): If True, the processing result is displayed in the window. By default, False.
- **show_fps** (bool): If True, the current FPS is displayed on the frame. By default, True.
- **output_video_path** (str): The path to save the processed video. The default is "output_video.mp4".
